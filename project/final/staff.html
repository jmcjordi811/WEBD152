            Since a young age, Jordi Mejia, now our Activities Coordinator, being a California North Coast local, has embodied our values and now trains and shares his knowledge to each of our guides to ensure that you, our guests, have the most fun and safe experience while staying with us at Pacific Trails Resort. Through his fascination and love of nature, his experience in hiking, kayaking, and bird watching has made him the perfect fit for this position. His message to our guests is that "Anyone can stay at a hotel but what we provide here is an experience, something that, hopefully, you can take with you and share as a moment in your life where you said 'Hello' to adventure and 'Goodbye' to the stresses of life."
