    <p>My favorite drink is a refresher that they serve at Starbucks called Strawberry Acai with lemonade<br> 
        I usually get one every week since I read somewhere that lemonade tends to cheer up one's day and for me it does.<br>
        Straberries are my favorite berries because fun fact they are not necessarily fruit given its unique composition.
